## Overview

This package provides a unified interface for transmission grid planning problems on realistic power system networks. Operational decisions (line switching) and capital investments (line hardening, battery storage siting, solar PV siting) are co-optimized under a single objective — load shedding, generation cost, risk exposure, or a weighted tradeoff. The per-line risk interface is hazard-agnostic; the package ships with built-in data loaders for severe-weather risk applications, currently wildfire risk via the USGS Fire Potential Index.

**Key Features:**
- **Four formulations**: wildfire-aware switching (DCOTS, LACOTS) and pure power-flow baselines (DCOPF, LACOPF) sharing the same investment-planning interface
- **Multiple objective functions**: Load shedding minimization, risk-exposure minimization, generation cost minimization, and customizable tradeoffs
- **Two switching methods**: Optimal MIP-based and fast thresholded heuristic
- **Line hardening**: Optimize infrastructure investments (vegetation management, covered conductors, or undergrounding) to permanently reduce per-line risk exposure
- **Battery energy storage systems (BESS)**: Optimize battery installation and operation for load shedding mitigation
- **Solar PV installation**: Optimize solar capacity placement with hourly capacity factors and inverter reactive power support (LACOTS)
- **Hazard-agnostic risk interface**: Accept any per-line risk signal; built-in loader for USGS Fire Potential Index (wildfire) included
- **Multi-period optimization**: Solve for single days, specific date ranges, or entire months/years
- **Flexible network support**: Pre-configured for 6+ realistic power system test cases (RTS-GMLC, CATS, Texas7k, ACTIVSg2000/10k, WECC240)

## Available Data

### Included Reference Dataset

This repository ships with a **reference dataset (`test_data/`) limited to June 2020** (June 2021 for RTS) for all six networks. This subset is sufficient for testing, demos, and single-month analyses. For other time periods, use `fetch_wfpi_data.jl` to download WFPI risk data, or supply custom data via the `:risk_per_line` parameter.

The full dataset lives in `data/` (gitignored). To regenerate `test_data/` from `data/`, run:
```bash
julia scripts/generate_reference_data.jl
```

### Solar Capacity Factor Data

Solar capacity factor data (TMY hourly profiles from NREL PVWatts) is included in `test_data/solar_data/` for small networks only, due to GitHub's 100 MB file size limit:

| Network | Included in repo |
|---------|-----------------|
| RTS     | ✓ |
| WECC240 | ✓ |
| texas2k | ✓ |
| Texas7k | ✗ (157 MB) |
| CATS    | ✗ (196 MB) |
| WECC10k | ✗ (230 MB) |

To generate solar data locally for any network, run:
```bash
export NREL_API_KEY=your_key_here  # get a free key at https://developer.nlr.gov/signup/
julia --project=scripts scripts/generate_solar_data.jl --network Texas7k
```
This fetches TMY data from the NREL PVWatts API and writes to `data/solar_data/{Network}/solar_data.csv`. Then re-run `generate_reference_data.jl` to populate `test_data/solar_data/`.

### Census Demographic Data

Per-bus Census ACS 5-year demographics (total population, households, race, Hispanic/Latino ethnicity, poverty, household-income brackets, median income) are pulled via the Census Data API and aggregated from census tracts to load buses.

The pipeline runs in three stages:

1. **Tract selection.** Every census tract whose centroid lies within a per-bus radius (default 25 km) of *any* bus is selected. This union-of-disks filter keeps sparse networks (e.g. WECC240) from pulling tracts in the empty regions between distant buses.
2. **ACS fetch.** The Census Data API (`api.census.gov/data`, free) returns demographics for each selected tract. A free key is optional — anonymous access is capped at ~500 requests per day. Get one at <https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html>.
3. **Tract → bus aggregation.** A 3-pass radius algorithm assigns tract populations to load buses (guaranteeing every populated tract is covered and every load bus receives population), then tract-level counts are summed with weights to per-bus totals. `median_income` is population-weighted across assigned tracts.

Generate data for a network:
```bash
export CENSUS_API_KEY=your_key_here   # optional
julia --project=. scripts/generate_census_data.jl --network RTS
julia --project=. scripts/generate_census_data.jl --network WECC240 --radius-km 50
julia --project=. scripts/generate_census_data.jl --network RTS --weighting proportional
julia --project=. scripts/generate_census_data.jl --network RTS --acs-year 2021
```

Requires the national tract shapefile (~100 MB, gitignored):
```bash
curl -L -o data/US_Shapefiles/cb_2023_us_tract_500k.zip \
  https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/GENZ2023/shp/cb_2023_us_tract_500k.zip
unzip -o data/US_Shapefiles/cb_2023_us_tract_500k.zip -d data/US_Shapefiles/
```

Output: a single CSV per (network, ACS year) at `data/census_data/{Network}_census_{Year}.csv`:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `Bus_ID` | Bus identifier matching the network case file |
| `total_pop` | Weighted sum of tract population (B01003_001E) |
| `num_households` | Weighted sum of households (B11001_001E) |
| `num_white`, `num_black`, `num_native`, `num_asian` | Race counts (B02001_002–005E) |
| `num_hispanic` | Hispanic/Latino count (B03003_003E) |
| `num_below_poverty`, `num_above_poverty` | Poverty counts (B17001_001/002E) |
| `num_low_income`, `num_middle_income`, `num_high_income` | Households with income <$35k / $35–100k / ≥$100k (B19001 brackets) |
| `median_income` | Population-weighted median household income ($) (B19013_001E) |

All `num_*` columns are absolute counts (`Σ weight × tract_count` over assigned tracts); derive percentages downstream as needed. Rows are emitted only for load buses (buses with non-zero active load).

**Weighting modes** (`--weighting`):

- `inverse` (default) — `w_i = (1/d_i) / Σ(1/d_j)`. Closer buses get larger shares.
- `proportional` — `w_i = d_i / Σ d_j`. Matches the original spec literally; farther buses get larger shares.

**Plot overlay** on `:network_overview`: pass `census_overlay=:median_income` (or `:pct_poverty`, `:pct_nonwhite`) to `plot_results` to color each load bus by the metric. The plot falls back gracefully with a warning if the CSV is absent.

Load results back into Julia with `load_census_data(network; acs_year=2022)`.

## Models and Methods

### Optimization Models

#### DCOTS (DC Optimal Transmission Switching)
- Uses linearized DC power flow approximation
- Decision variables: voltage angles, generation, power flows, load shedding, line switching
- Optional: line hardening decisions (y variables)
- Computationally efficient for large-scale problems
- Ignores reactive power and voltage magnitude constraints

#### LACOTS (Linear AC Optimal Transmission Switching)
- Uses linearized AC power flow
- Includes reactive power and voltage magnitude variables
- Optional: line hardening decisions (y variables)
- More accurate representation of AC power systems
- Can warm-start from DCOTS solution for faster convergence (includes z and y values)

#### DCOPF / LACOPF (Pure Power Flow — no wildfire switching)
- Same DC / linearized-AC formulations as DCOTS / LACOTS, but with all wildfire-risk machinery disabled:
  no binary `z` switching variables, no risk threshold, no auto-loaded wildfire data
- Lines are never de-energized to mitigate risk — useful as a no-action baseline or for studies that
  shouldn't be biased by wildfire considerations
- Investment options (battery, solar, hardening) still apply and are co-optimized as usual
- Allowed objectives: `"loadshed"` and `"cost"` only (`"wildfire"` and `"tradeoff"` require risk data)
- LACOPF can warm-start from DCOPF (`:warm_start => "auto"`)

### Solution Methods

#### Optimal Method (default)
- Solves a Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) problem for line switching decisions
- Binary `z[d,l]` variables for each risky line switching decision
- If a `threshold` or `threshold_pct` is provided, adds a linear risk constraint: energized risk ≤ threshold × total_risk (hardening is credited toward the threshold)
- If no threshold is provided and the objective includes wildfire risk (e.g., `"wildfire"`, `"tradeoff"`), risk minimization is handled in the objective
- If hardening is enabled, binary `y[l]` variables are always added regardless of switching method
- **Pros**: Globally optimal switching decisions, optimality guarantees
- **Cons**: Slower solve times (seconds to minutes for large systems)

#### Thresholded Method
- Fast heuristic that pre-determines switching decisions before solving
- Sorts risky lines by wildfire risk and de-energizes the riskiest ones to meet the specified threshold (`threshold` or `threshold_pct` required)
- Switching variables are fixed scalars; the remaining problem is solved as an LP (or MIP if hardening is enabled)
- If hardening is enabled, binary `y[l]` variables are still solved optimally within the LP/MIP
- **Pros**: 2-10x faster solve times for large-scale studies
- **Cons**: Switching decisions are suboptimal; threshold parameter is required
- **Use cases**: Large-scale studies, Monte Carlo analysis, initial screening

### Objective Functions

| Objective | Description | Primary Term | Secondary Term | OPF-only models |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|----------------|-----------------|
| `"loadshed"` | Minimize load shedding | Total load shed | Small switching cost penalty | ✅ |
| `"wildfire"` | Minimize wildfire risk | Normalized active risk | Small load shedding penalty | ❌ (requires risk) |
| `"cost"` | Minimize operational cost | Generation cost + VOLL × load shed | N/A | ✅ |
| `"tradeoff"` | Weighted combination | (1-w) × normalized load shed | w × normalized risk | ❌ (requires risk) |

### Line Hardening

The package supports transmission line hardening as a wildfire risk mitigation strategy alongside operational switching decisions. The hardening decision represents a permanent physical intervention — vegetation management, covered conductors, or undergrounding — that reduces a line's wildfire risk contribution by a user-defined effectiveness factor. The default cost parameter (`$7M/mile`) reflects undergrounding; adjust `:hardening_cost_per_mile` to model other methods.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Decision variable y[l]**: Binary variable indicating whether line l is hardened (1) or not (0)
- **Risk mitigation**: Hardened lines have their wildfire risk reduced by an effectiveness factor (default: 100%)
- **Energization enforcement**: Hardened lines must remain energized (cannot be switched off)
- **Cost-based optimization**: Balances hardening cost against operational benefits

**Budget Handling:**
- **Non-cost objectives** (loadshed, wildfire, tradeoff): Budget is required (default: $1B if not specified)
- **Cost objective**: Budget is optional (default: unlimited). Hardening cost appears in objective function.

**Thresholded Method with Hardening:**
When using the thresholded method with hardening enabled, switching and hardening decisions are decoupled:
- Switching decisions (`z`) are pre-computed by sorting lines by risk and de-energizing the riskiest ones to meet the threshold
- Hardening decisions (`y`) remain binary optimization variables solved optimally by the LP/MIP solver
- Hardenable lines that were thresholded off use `y[l]` as their effective energization variable in power flow constraints — a hardened line is re-energized with zero wildfire risk contribution
- The shared infrastructure budget is enforced as a linear constraint over the binary `y` variables (and any battery/solar variables)

**Objective Modifications:**
- **loadshed**: Adds small penalty for not hardening: `+ 0.01 * Σ(1-y[l])`
- **wildfire**: Risk from hardened lines is reduced: `risk[l] * (1 - effectiveness * y[l])`
- **cost**: Adds hardening cost: `+ Σ(cost_per_mile * length[l] * y[l])`
- **tradeoff**: Uses modified risk calculation from wildfire objective

## Quick Start

The repository ships with a reference dataset in `test_data/` covering June 2020 for all six networks. Use `:data_dir => "test_data"` to run immediately after cloning — no additional data download required.

```julia
using PowerGridPlanning

# Works out of the box using the included test_data/ reference dataset
opt_parameters = Dict(
    :network   => "RTS",
    :model     => "DCOTS",
    :objective => "loadshed",
    :times     => [(2020, 6, 15)],   # June 15, 2020 — available for all 6 networks
    :data_dir  => "test_data"
)

results = solve_ots(opt_parameters)

println("Solve time: $(results[:solve_time]) seconds")
println("Total load shed: $(results[:total_load_shed]) MW")
println("Risk reduction: $(results[:risk_reduction_pct])%")
println("Lines switched off: $(length(results[:switched_off_lines][1]))")
```

To verify all six networks load and solve correctly:

```bash
julia --project=. scripts/verify_reference_data.jl
```

> **Note:** `test_data/` covers June 2020 (June 15–16 for CATS; June 4–30 for RTS; full June for all others). For other dates or the full dataset, omit `:data_dir` (defaults to `"data/"`) and download wildfire risk data via `scripts/fetch_wfpi_data.jl`.

## Tutorial

A Jupyter notebook walkthrough is included at [`tutorial.ipynb`](tutorial.ipynb). It covers the core API end-to-end on the RTS network — basic solve, switching methods, hardening, battery and solar siting, the tradeoff curve, and plotting — using only the bundled `test_data/` so it runs out of the box after `Pkg.instantiate()` and a Gurobi license.

```bash
julia --project=. -e 'using IJulia; notebook(dir=".")'
```

Then open `tutorial.ipynb` from the Jupyter file browser.

## Usage Guide

### Basic API

The main function is `solve_ots(opt_parameters)` which takes a single dictionary and returns a results dictionary.

```julia

results = solve_ots(opt_parameters)
```

### Required Parameters

```julia
opt_parameters = Dict(
    :network => "RTS",                    # Network name (see Available Data)
    :model => "DCOTS",                    # "DCOTS", "LACOTS", "DCOPF", or "LACOPF"
                                          #   DCOTS/LACOTS: wildfire-aware optimal transmission switching
                                          #   DCOPF/LACOPF: pure OPF (no wildfire switching);
                                          #                 investments still apply; objective restricted to "loadshed"/"cost"
    :objective => "tradeoff",             # "loadshed", "wildfire", "cost", "tradeoff" (DCOPF/LACOPF: "loadshed"/"cost" only)
    :times => [(2021, 7, 15)]             # Time specification (see below)

### Time Specification Formats

```julia

# Multiple specific days
:times => [(2021, 7, 15), (2021, 7, 16), (2021, 7, 17)]

# Full year (all 365/366 days)
:times => "2020"

# Full month
:times => "June 2021"
:times => "Jun 2021"
```

The number of days `D` is automatically calculated, resulting in `D × T` time periods.

## Results Dictionary

The `solve_ots()` function returns a dictionary with the following keys:

### Optimization Status
- `:status` - Termination status (e.g., `OPTIMAL`, `TIME_LIMIT`)
- `:solve_time` - Solver runtime in seconds
- `:objective_value` - Final objective function value
- `:switching_method` - Solution method used (`"optimal"` or `"thresholded"`)

### Decision Variables
- `:z` - Line switching decisions `[D × risky_lines]` (1=energized, 0=de-energized)
- `:va` - Voltage angles `[D × T × buses]` (radians)
- `:p` - Real power flows `[D × T × branches]` (MW)
- `:g` or `:pg` - Real power generation `[D × T × generators]` (MW)

- `:qg` - Reactive power generation `[D × T × generators]` (MVAr)
- `:q_load_shedding` - Reactive load shedding `[D × T × buses]` (MVAr)

### Summary Metrics
- `:total_load_shed` - Total load shedding across all periods (MW)
- `:total_risk` - Total possible wildfire risk (baseline)
- `:active_risk` - Wildfire risk from energized lines (accounts for hardening if enabled)
- `:removed_risk` - Wildfire risk eliminated by switching
- `:risk_reduction_pct` - Percentage of risk removed
- `:switched_off_lines` - Dict mapping day index to list of de-energized line IDs

**Notes:**
- For the thresholded method, `:z` values are pre-computed fixed scalars (0 or 1), not optimization variables
- `:y` values are always binary optimization variables when hardening is enabled, regardless of switching method
- When hardening is enabled, `:active_risk` accounts for risk reduction from hardened lines
- Battery capacity `:x[n]` is a continuous variable (p.u.); buses with capacity < 0.01 p.u. are considered uninstalled
- Solar capacity `:s[n]` is a continuous variable (p.u.); buses with capacity < 0.01 p.u. are considered uninstalled

## Plotting

```julia
plot_results(results_input, features::Vector{Symbol};
             format::String="pdf",
             output_dir::String=".",
             day::Union{Nothing,Int}=nothing,
             infrastructure_off::Bool=false,
             ls_off::Bool=false,
             plot_dir::String="",
             kwargs...)
```

- `features`: vector of plot symbols to generate (see below)
- `format`: output format — `"pdf"` (default), `"png"`, `"svg"`, `"eps"`
- `output_dir`: directory to write output files
- `plot_dir`: alias for `output_dir`; takes precedence over `output_dir` if non-empty

**Feature symbols:**

| Symbol | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `:network_overview` | Geographic plot: risk-colored lines, de-energized lines, hardened lines, battery/solar markers, load shed bubbles |
| `:load_shed_timeseries` | Time series of load shedding across all periods |
| `:battery_dispatch` | Per-bus battery charge/discharge/SOC dispatch |

**Examples:**

```julia
# Full network overview with all layers

# Tradeoff curve from multiple solves
results_list = [solve_ots(merge(p, Dict(:tradeoff_weight => w))) for w in 0:0.1:1]
plot_results(results_list, [:tradeoff_curve]; format="pdf", output_dir="figures/")
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic DCOTS with Tradeoff Objective

```julia
using PowerGridPlanning

opt_parameters = Dict(
    :network => "RTS",
    :model => "DCOTS",
    :objective => "tradeoff",
    :times => [(2020, 6, 15)],
    :data_dir => "test_data",
    :tradeoff_weight => 0.7,  # Prioritize wildfire risk reduction
    :time_limit => 300.0
)

results = solve_ots(opt_parameters)

# Access results
println("Optimized in $(results[:solve_time]) seconds")
println("$(results[:risk_reduction_pct])% of wildfire risk removed")
println("$(results[:total_load_shed]) MW of load shed")
```

### Example 2: LACOTS with DCOTS Warm Start

```julia
# Automatically runs DCOTS first, then uses solution to warm-start LACOTS
opt_parameters = Dict(
    :network => "RTS",
    :model => "LACOTS",
    :objective => "loadshed",
    :times => [(2020, 6, 15)],
    :data_dir => "test_data",
    :warm_start => "auto"
)

results = solve_ots(opt_parameters)
```

### Example 2b: Pure DCOPF Baseline (no wildfire switching)

```julia
# Use DCOPF when you want a true no-action baseline — lines never get
# de-energized for risk mitigation, even under a "cost" or "loadshed" objective.
opt_parameters = Dict(
    :network   => "RTS",
    :model     => "DCOPF",          # pure DC OPF; no z switching variables
    :objective => "cost",           # generation cost + VOLL × load shed
    :times     => [(2020, 6, 15)],
    :data_dir  => "test_data",
)

results = solve_ots(opt_parameters)

# DCOPF results have no switching: results[:switched_off_lines][d] is empty
# and risk_reduction_pct is 0. Investment options (battery, solar, hardening)
# can still be enabled in the same Dict.
```

### Example 3: Fast Thresholded Method

```julia
# Remove 50% of wildfire risk using fast heuristic
opt_parameters = Dict(
    :network => "Texas7k",
    :model => "DCOTS",
    :objective => "loadshed",
    :times => [(2020, 6, 11), (2020, 6, 12), (2020, 6, 13)],
    :data_dir => "test_data",
    :switching_method => "thresholded",
    :threshold_pct => 0.5,  # De-energize lines to remove 50% of risk
    :time_limit => 300.0
)

results = solve_ots(opt_parameters)

# Compare performance vs optimal method
println("Thresholded solve time: $(results[:solve_time])s")
println("Load shed: $(results[:total_load_shed]) MW")
```

### Example 4: Multi-Period Optimization

```julia
# Optimize for entire month
opt_parameters = Dict(
    :network => "RTS",
    :model => "DCOTS",
    :objective => "wildfire",
    :times => "June 2020",  # All days in June
    :data_dir => "test_data",
    :T => 24,
    :mip_gap => 0.02
)

results = solve_ots(opt_parameters)

# Analyze daily switching patterns
for (day_idx, lines) in results[:switched_off_lines]
    println("Day $day_idx: $(length(lines)) lines de-energized")
end
```

### Example 5: CATS Network with Custom Risk Metric

```julia
opt_parameters = Dict(
    :network => "CATS",
    :model => "DCOTS",
    :objective => "tradeoff",
    :times => [(2020, 6, 15)],
    :data_dir => "test_data",
    :risk_metric => "max_wfpi",  # Use maximum WFPI instead of cumulative
    :tradeoff_weight => 0.6
)

results = solve_ots(opt_parameters)
```

### Example 6: Cost Minimization

```julia
opt_parameters = Dict(
    :network => "RTS",
    :model => "DCOTS",
    :objective => "cost",
    :times => [(2020, 6, 15)],
    :data_dir => "test_data",
    :voll => 10000.0,  # $10,000/MWh value of lost load
    :threshold_pct => 0.3  # Still enforce some risk reduction
)

results = solve_ots(opt_parameters)

println("Total cost: \$$(results[:objective_value])")
```

### Example 7: Save Results to File

```julia
# Save results as JLD2 file
opt_parameters = Dict(
    :network => "Texas2k",
    :model => "DCOTS",
    :objective => "loadshed",
    :times => "June 2020",
    :data_dir => "test_data",
    :switching_method => "thresholded",
    :threshold_pct => 0.4,
    :output_format => "jld2",
    :output_path => "results/texas2k_june2020_results.jld2"
)

results = solve_ots(opt_parameters)

# Load results later
using JLD2
loaded_results = load("results/texas2k_june2020_results.jld2")
```

### Example 8: Export Model and Solver Logs

```julia
# Save the optimization model formulation and Gurobi solver log
opt_parameters = Dict(
    :network => "RTS",
    :model => "DCOTS",
    :objective => "tradeoff",
    :times => [(2020, 6, 15)],
    :data_dir => "test_data",
    :tradeoff_weight => 0.5,
    :lp_str => "models/rts_dcots_tradeoff.lp",  # Save model to LP file
    :log_str => "logs/rts_dcots_solve.log"      # Save Gurobi log to file
)

results = solve_ots(opt_parameters)

# The LP file contains the full model formulation:
# - Decision variables, objective function, all constraints
# The log file contains Gurobi's detailed solver output:
# - Presolve reductions, barrier/simplex iterations, MIP progress
# - Useful for debugging, performance analysis, and verification
```

### Example 9: Comparison Study

```julia
# Compare optimal vs thresholded methods
function compare_methods(network, date, threshold_pct)
    # Optimal method
    opt_params_optimal = Dict(
        :network => network,
        :model => "DCOTS",
        :objective => "loadshed",
        :times => [date],
        :data_dir => "test_data",
        :switching_method => "optimal",
        :threshold_pct => threshold_pct
    )
    results_optimal = solve_ots(opt_params_optimal)

    # Thresholded method

        :threshold_pct => threshold_pct
    )
    results_threshold = solve_ots(opt_params_threshold)

    # Compare

### Example 10: Line Hardening with Loadshed Objective

```julia
# Optimize line hardening to reduce wildfire risk while minimizing load shedding
opt_parameters = Dict(
    :network => "RTS",
    :model => "DCOTS",
    :objective => "loadshed",
    :times => [(2020, 6, 15)],
    :data_dir => "test_data",
    :hardening_enabled => true,
    :infrastructure_budget => 50e6,  # $50M shared budget
    :hardening_cost_per_mile => 7e6,  # $7M per mile
    :hardening_effectiveness => 1.0,  # 100% risk mitigation
    :hardening_enforce_energization => true
)

results = solve_ots(opt_parameters)

# Analyze hardening results
println("Lines hardened: $(length(results[:hardened_lines]))")
println("Hardening cost: \$$(results[:hardening_cost]/1e6)M")
println("Risk mitigated by hardening: $(results[:mitigated_risk])")
println("Remaining active risk: $(results[:active_risk])")
println("Total risk reduction: $(results[:risk_reduction_pct])%")

# View which lines were hardened
for line_id in results[:hardened_lines]
    println("  Line $line_id: hardened (y=$( results[:y][line_id]))")
end
```

### Example 11: Cost Minimization with Hardening

```julia
# Optimize hardening and operations together to minimize total cost
opt_parameters = Dict(
    :network => "RTS",
    :model => "DCOTS",
    :objective => "cost",
    :times => [(2020, 6, 15)],
    :data_dir => "test_data",
    :voll => 10000.0,
    :hardening_enabled => true,
    :hardening_cost_per_mile => 7e6
    # No budget limit - optimizer decides based on cost-benefit analysis
)

results = solve_ots(opt_parameters)

println("Total cost: \$$(results[:objective_value])")
println("Hardening cost: \$$(results[:hardening_cost]/1e6)M")
println("Generation + load shed cost: \$$(results[:objective_value] - results[:hardening_cost])")
```

### Example 12: Thresholded Switching with Optimal Hardening

```julia
# Switching decisions pre-computed (thresholded), hardening solved optimally (MIP)
# Hardenable lines that were thresholded off can be re-energized by hardening them
opt_parameters = Dict(
    :network => "Texas7k",
    :model => "DCOTS",
    :objective => "loadshed",
    :times => [(2020, 6, 11), (2020, 6, 12)],
    :data_dir => "test_data",
    :switching_method => "thresholded",
    :threshold_pct => 0.5,  # Pre-de-energize top-50%-risk lines
    :hardening_enabled => true,
    :infrastructure_budget => 100e6,  # $100M shared budget
    :hardening_effectiveness => 0.9   # 90% risk reduction when hardened
)

results = solve_ots(opt_parameters)

# Compare hardening vs switching for risk mitigation
println("Risk mitigated by hardening: $(results[:mitigated_risk])")
println("Risk removed by switching: $(results[:removed_risk])")
println("Total risk reduction: $(results[:risk_reduction_pct])%")
println("Solve time: $(results[:solve_time])s")
```

### Example 13: Battery Installation on CATS Network

```julia
# Install batteries on the California Test System during a high wildfire risk day
# Verified result: 29 buses, ~1517 MWh installed, $303M cost, 0 MW load shed
opt_parameters = Dict(
    :network => "CATS",
    :model => "DCOTS",
    :objective => "loadshed",
    :times => [(2020, 6, 21)],
    :data_dir => "test_data",
    :switching_method => "thresholded",
    :threshold_pct => 0.75,          # De-energize lines to remove 75% of risk
    :battery_enabled => true,
    :battery_cost_per_pu => 2e7,     # $20M per 100 MWh
    :infrastructure_budget => 500e6, # $500M shared budget
    :time_limit => 3600.0
)

results = solve_ots(opt_parameters)

# Confirm batteries were installed
println("Buses with batteries: $(length(results[:batteries_installed]))")
println("Total capacity: $(round(results[:total_battery_capacity]*100, digits=1)) MWh")
println("Battery cost: \$$(round(results[:battery_cost]/1e6, digits=1))M")
println("Load shed: $(results[:total_load_shed]) MW")

# Inspect 24-hour dispatch for a specific bus
bus = results[:batteries_installed][1]
capacity = results[:x][bus]
println("\nDispatch at bus $bus ($(round(capacity*100, digits=1)) MWh):")
println("Hour | Charge (p.u.) | Discharge (p.u.) | SOC (%)")
for t in 1:24
    charge    = results[:p_charge][(1, t, bus)]
    discharge = results[:p_discharge][(1, t, bus)]
    soc_pct   = 100 * results[:soc][(1, t, bus)] / capacity
    println("  $t  |   $(round(charge, digits=4))   |   $(round(discharge, digits=4))   |  $(round(soc_pct, digits=1))%")
end
```

**Notes on this example:**
- CATS is a large network (8,870 buses, 10,823 lines) — expect ~4 minute solve time
- On a single high-risk day, batteries start fully charged and purely discharge to cover load shed from de-energized lines (no charging needed within the day)
- The `time_limit` of 3600s is recommended for CATS; smaller networks solve much faster

### Example 14: Custom Wildfire Risk Data

You can bypass automatic data loading by providing your own wildfire risk data via the `:risk_per_line` parameter. This is useful for custom risk models, sensitivity analysis, or external data sources.

```julia
using PowerGridPlanning

# Define custom risk: Dict{day_index => Dict{line_id => risk_value}}
custom_risk = Dict{Int, Dict{Int, Float64}}(
    1 => Dict(5 => 0.8, 12 => 1.2, 23 => 0.5, 45 => 0.9),  # Day 1
    2 => Dict(5 => 0.9, 12 => 1.1, 23 => 0.4),              # Day 2
    3 => Dict(8 => 0.7, 23 => 0.6, 45 => 1.0)               # Day 3
)

opt_parameters = Dict(
    :network => "RTS",
    :model => "DCOTS",
    :objective => "tradeoff",
    :times => [(2020, 6, 15), (2020, 6, 16), (2020, 6, 17)],
    :data_dir => "test_data",
    :risk_per_line => custom_risk,
    :tradeoff_weight => 0.5
)

results = solve_ots(opt_parameters)

# Output includes validation:
# ✓ risk_per_line validation passed:
#   - 3 days of data
#   - 11 total line-day risk entries
#   - Min/Max risky lines per day: 3/4
# ✓ Using user-provided risk_per_line data

println("Active risk: $(results[:active_risk])")
println("Risk reduction: $(results[:risk_reduction_pct])%")
```

**Notes:**
- The outer key is the day index (1 to D), matching the order of `:times`
- The inner dict maps line IDs to risk values — only lines with nonzero risk need entries
- The package validates the structure and reports statistics when custom data is provided

### Example 15: Combined Infrastructure Optimization

Jointly optimize solar PV, battery storage, and line hardening under a shared infrastructure budget.

```julia
using PowerGridPlanning

opt_parameters = Dict(
    :network => "RTS",
    :model => "DCOTS",
    :objective => "loadshed",
    :times => [(2020, 6, 15)],
    :data_dir => "test_data",
    :switching_method => "thresholded",
    :threshold_pct => 0.75,
    # Solar
    :solar_enabled => true,
    :solar_cost_per_pu => 5e7,                                        # $50M per 100 MW
    :solar_data_path => "test_data/solar_data/RTS/solar_data.csv",
    # Battery
    :battery_enabled => true,
    :battery_cost_per_pu => 2e7,     # $20M per 100 MWh
    # Hardening
    :hardening_enabled => true,
    :hardening_cost_per_mile => 7e6,
    # Shared budget for all three
    :infrastructure_budget => 500e6  # $500M
)

results = solve_ots(opt_parameters)

# The optimizer allocates the shared budget across all three investments
println("Solar:     \$$(round(results[:solar_cost]/1e6, digits=1))M — $(length(results[:solar_installed])) buses")
println("Batteries: \$$(round(results[:battery_cost]/1e6, digits=1))M — $(length(results[:batteries_installed])) buses")
println("Hardening: \$$(round(results[:hardening_cost]/1e6, digits=1))M — $(length(results[:hardened_lines])) lines")
total_infra = results[:solar_cost] + results[:battery_cost] + results[:hardening_cost]
println("Total:     \$$(round(total_infra/1e6, digits=1))M / \$500M budget")
println("Load shed: $(results[:total_load_shed]) MW")
```

### Example 16: Auto-Plotting via opt_parameters

Trigger plotting automatically at the end of `solve_ots()` using the `:plots` and `:plot_dir` parameters, without calling `plot_results()` separately.

```julia
using PowerGridPlanning

# "all" generates network_overview + relevant timeseries plots
opt_parameters = Dict(
    :network => "RTS",
    :model => "DCOTS",
    :objective => "loadshed",
    :times => [(2020, 6, 15)],
    :data_dir => "test_data",
    :battery_enabled => true,
    :battery_cost_per_pu => 2e7,
    :infrastructure_budget => 500e6,
    :plots => "all",                    # Auto-plot after solve
    :plot_dir => "figures/rts_run1"     # Directory created automatically if needed
)

results = solve_ots(opt_parameters)
# Plots saved to figures/rts_run1/ automatically

# Other :plots options:
#   false or "none"       — no plots (default)
#   "all"                 — network_overview + all applicable timeseries
#   "inv_only"            — network_overview only
#   "timeseries_only"     — timeseries plots only (load_shed, battery_dispatch, etc.)
```

### Example 17: Solar PV Installation with Reactive Power Support

Solar PV installation planning with real solar irradiance data and inverter reactive power capability in the LACOTS model.

```julia
using PowerGridPlanning

# LACOTS solar with reactive power support
opt_parameters = Dict(
    :network => "RTS",
    :model => "LACOTS",
    :objective => "loadshed",
    :times => [(2020, 6, 15)],
    :data_dir => "test_data",
    :switching_method => "thresholded",
    :threshold_pct => 0.75,
    :solar_enabled => true,
    :solar_cost_per_pu => 5e7,                                       # $50M per 100 MW
    :solar_data_path => "test_data/solar_data/RTS/solar_data.csv",   # Hourly capacity factors
    :infrastructure_budget => 500e6,
    :linearized_solar_power => true    # Rectangular inverter capability: |Q| ≤ cf × S
    # Alternative: linearized_solar_power => false  for circular: P² + Q² ≤ S²
)

results = solve_ots(opt_parameters)

println("Solar installed: $(length(results[:solar_installed])) buses")
println("Total capacity: $(round(results[:total_solar_capacity]*100, digits=1)) MW")
println("Total P generation: $(round(results[:total_solar_generation], digits=2)) p.u.·h")
println("Total Q injection: $(round(results[:total_solar_q_injection], digits=2)) p.u.·h")
println("Solar cost: \$$(round(results[:solar_cost]/1e6, digits=1))M")

# Show hourly dispatch for an installed bus
bus = results[:solar_installed][1]
cap = results[:s][bus]
println("\nBus $bus ($(round(cap*100, digits=1)) MW) hourly P/Q:")
for t in 1:24
    p = round(results[:p_solar][(1, t, bus)], digits=4)
    q = round(results[:q_solar][(1, t, bus)], digits=4)
    println("  Hour $t: P=$p, Q=$q")
end
```

**Notes on this example:**
- Solar capacity factors are loaded from CSV with columns `Bus_ID, Hour, AC_Output_pu, DC_Output_pu`
- AC output (post-inverter) is used as the capacity factor — the correct value for grid-side modeling
- `q_solar` is bidirectional: positive = injection (capacitive), negative = absorption (inductive)
- At night (cf=0), `q_solar` is forced to zero (inverter offline)
- The linearized mode bounds Q by `cf × s[n]`, while nonlinear allows Q up to `s[n]` when P is low
